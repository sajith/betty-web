To get started, you need GHC, haskell-platform, cabal-install,
postgresql, and yesod-bin.  Please see the appropriate documentation
for how to install these.

The Yesod quickstart guide is particularly helpful:

    http://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart

To build this project:

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --enable-tests --reorder-goals --max-backjumps=-1 -j

We also need a PostgreSQL database.  To quickly set up database:

    sudo -u postgres createuser betty_devel
    sudo -u postgres createdb betty_devel

    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# alter user betty_devel with encrypted password 'secret'; 
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database betty_devel to betty_devel;

Now edit secrets.m4 to set appropriate usernames and passwords you
might want to use, and then run 'make'.  This will create the right
configuration, and you should be mostly ready to start the web app:

    yesod devel

(I suppose I should be sorry about using m4 this way.)
