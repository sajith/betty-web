# A Keter app is composed of 1 or more stanzas. The main stanza will define our
# web application. See the Keter documentation for more information on
# available stanzas.
stanzas:

  # Your Yesod application.
  - type: webapp

    # Name of your executable. You are unlikely to need to change this.
    # Note that all file paths are relative to the keter.yml file.
    exec: ../dist/bin/betty

    # Command line options passed to your application.
    args:
      - production

    hosts:
      # You can specify one or more hostnames for your application to respond
      # to. The primary hostname will be used for generating your application
      # root.
      - KETER_HOST

    # Enable to force Keter to redirect to https
    # Can be added to any stanza
    # requires-secure: true

    # Useful when Nginx <--> Keter
    ssl: true

  # Static files.
  - type: static-files
    hosts:
      - KETER_STATIC_HOST
    root: ../static

# Use the following to automatically copy your bundle upon creation via `yesod
# keter`. Uses `scp` internally, so you can set it to a remote destination
copy-to: KETER_USER@KETER_HOST:/opt/keter/incoming/

# You can pass arguments to `scp` used above. This example limits bandwidth to
# 1024 Kbit/s and uses port 2222 instead of the default 22
# copy-to-args:
#   - "-l 1024"
#   - "-P 2222"

# If you would like to have Keter automatically create a PostgreSQL database
# and set appropriate environment variables for it to be discovered, uncomment
# the following line.
# plugins:
#   postgres: true
